**Add a new entry**

Press the '+' button and select the type of the new PlayerPref entry. It's not possible to modify this type later. Add the key for the new entry in the upcoming dialog field. Additionally the dialog will provide feedback when it detected unintended overrides or invalid characters.

**Remove a existing entry**

Select the entry from the list that you want to delete. Press the '-' button to remove this entry. Confirm the warning dialog to finish the operation.

**Modify a existing entry**

To change a value of a existing entry do this directly in the value field in the PlayerPref list.

The plugin can monitor changes at runtime automatically and keep the view up-to-date. This detection is active by default, but it can be turned off over the (B) button in the toolbar.

**Sample Scene**
> Simple UI that manipulates PlayerPrefs entries on runtime.

### Limitations MacOS

Due to technical on MacOS it take time to update the persistent file that stores the PlayerPrefs. To avoid inconsistent data the plugin will show a loading screen until the data can be fully refreshed. Sorry for the inconvenience.
